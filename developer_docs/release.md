# Releasing the Driver

The following guide details the steps for releasing the Ansible Lifecycle Driver. This may only be performed by a user with admin rights to this Git repository and the `icr.io/cp4na-drivers` IBM Cloud Container Registry.

**Ensure you've followed the steps in [configure your development environment](dev-env.md) as there are libraries required to complete the release.**

## 1. Ensure Milestone

Ensure there is a milestone created for the release at: [https://github.com/IBM/ansible-lifecycle-driver/milestones](https://github.com/IBM/ansible-lifecycle-driver/milestones).

Also ensure all issues going into this release are assigned to this milestone. **Move any issues from unreleased milestones into this release if the code has been merged**

## 2. Update CHANGELOG (on develop)

Update the `CHANGELOG.md` file with a list of issues fixed by this release (see other items in this file to get an idea of the desired format).

Commit and push these changes.

## 3. Merge Develop to Master

Development work is normally carried out on the `develop` branch. Merge this branch to `master`, by creating a PR.

Then perform the release from the `master` branch. This ensures the `master` branch is tagged correctly. 

> Note: do NOT delete the `develop` branch
 
## 4. Build and Release (on master)

The `build.py` script automates the following steps: 

- Update the release version in pkg_info.json
- Build the Python whl for the driver library
- Build and Tag Docker Image
- Build Helm Chart
- Package Documentation
- Push Docker Image to `icr.io/cp4na-drivers` group on IBM Cloud Container Registry
- Create a tagged commit in the git repository to mark this release

To perform a release, run `build.py` and set the following options:

```
python3 build.py --release --version <THE VERSION TO BE RELEASED> --post-version <VERSION TO BE USED AFTER THE RELEASE> --ignition-version <VERSION OF IGNITION TO BE USED>
```

> Note: check the `ignition-version` in `pkg_info.json`, if it's already at the correct version then you do not need to include `--ignition-version`

For example:
```
python3 build.py --release --version 1.0.0 --post-version 1.0.1.dev0
```

## 5. Release artifacts

The Docker image has been pushed by the `build.py` script but the documentation and Helm chart packages must be uploaded manually to Github.

Complete the following:

- Visit the [releases](https://github.com/IBM/ansible-lifecycle-driver/releases) section of the driver repository
- Click `Draft a new release`
- Input the version the `--version` option earlier as the tag e.g. 1.0.0
- Use the same value for the `Release title` e.g. 1.0.0
- Add release notes in the description of the release. Look at previous releases to see the format. Usually, we will list the issues fixed. This is essentially the same content you have already added to `CHANGELOG.md` so just copy and paste the entry for this release, edit the header to say `Release Notes`.
- Attach the Helm chart `tgz` file produced by `build.py` in the `release-artifacts` directory
- Attach the documentation `tgz` file produced by `build.py` in the `release-artifacts` directory

## 6. Cleanup

Complete the following steps to ensure development can continue as normal:

- Merge `master` to `develop` (so any release updates and the post-version are copied over from master)
- Close the Milestone for this release on [Github](https://github.com/IBM/ansible-lifecycle-driver/milestones)
- Create a new Milestone for next release (if one does not exist). Use the value of the `--post-version` option from earlier
